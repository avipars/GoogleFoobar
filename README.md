# GoogleFoobar


A set of coding challenges that can get you hired by google!
It is rare, but it's a funnel for recruitment and some people actually got a job from this...

You are given a "terminal" with limited functionality... you'll mainly use cd, ls, cat, edit, verify and submit

At least for the first 5 challenges...

You can only code in Java or Python 2.7 as of now.
